THE SIERPINSKI TRIANGLE

A true mathematical wonder, this fractal was described by Polish 
mathematician Wacław Sierpiński in 1915. Unlike regular shapes, 
the Sierpinski Triangle continues its pattern infinitely inward.

Properties:
• Fractal dimension: approximately 1.585
• Total area approaches zero as iterations increase
• Appears in cellular automata and the Chaos Game
• Can be found in Pascal's Triangle (mod 2)

Simple way to create one:
1. Start with an equilateral triangle
2. Find the midpoint of each side
3. Connect these midpoints to create 4 triangles
4. Remove the middle triangle
5. Repeat the process for each remaining triangle

Fun fact: If you color odd numbers in Pascal's Triangle, 
you'll see the Sierpinski pattern emerge naturally!

that amazed me with their complex simplicity." - Benoit Mandelbrot
