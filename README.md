## 🧠 Shape Fun Facts

<details>
<summary>Click to expand some shape-tastic trivia!</summary>

- A circle has infinite sides, if you think about it...
- The pyramids of Egypt are actually square-based pyramids, not true tetrahedrons
- A cube has 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 6 faces
- The word "sphere" comes from the Greek "sphaira" meaning "ball"
- Hexagons are the most efficient shape for tiling a plane, which is why bees use them!
